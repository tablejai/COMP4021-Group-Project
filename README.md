# Installation
1. Installing the requirements via NPM

`npm install`

2. Running the backend
For debugging purposes I would recommend using nodemon cuz I am lazy
Probably should name a better name for the server script

`npx nodemon src/server/index.js`

3. Browing the webpage
Simply opening index.html in any browser

I suck at web programming so please tell me if anything can be improved lmao
