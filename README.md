# Introduction

* A simple multiplayer Tetris game with jank implementation using purely Javascript HTML and CSS with an Express and Socket.io Backend.
* A group project for the submission of the 2024 Spring COMP4021 Course in HKUST, partnering with @LeoLYW12138 and @VivianChan-TH


# Installation
1. Installing the requirements via NPM
   
`npm install`

3. Running the backend
For debugging purposes I would recommend using nodemon cuz I am lazy
Probably should name a better name for the server script

`npm run dev`

To run it properly, just use the following

`npm run start`

3. Browing the webpage
Opening localhost:8000, can also be connected from another client in the same LAN using <IP-OF-THE-HOST>:8000

## Sad Notes ðŸ¥²
* RIP my P5.js implementation where apparently packages not within the course's syllabus are not allowed
